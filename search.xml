    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Present continuous Let’s see an example: She is driving to work This means: She is driving now, at the time of speaking, The action is not finished 1. Am/is/are + ing is the present continuous I am doing something = I&#39;m in the middle of doing it; I&#39;ve started doing it and I haven&#39;t finished Please don’t make so much noise. I’m trying to work.(not I try) ‘Where’s Mark?’ ‘He’s having a shower.’ (not He has a shower) Let’s go out now. It isn’t raining any more. (not It doesn’t rain) What’s all that noise? What’s going on? (=What’s happening?) 2. Sometimes the action is not happening at the time of speaking. For example: Steve is talking to a friend on the phone. He says:I&#39;m reading a really good book at the moment.It&#39;s about a man who... Steve is no reading the book at the time of speaking. He means that he hasstarted it, but has not finished it yet. He is in the middle of reading it. More example as list: Kate wants to work in Italy, so she’s learning Italian. (but perhaps she isn’t learning Italian at the time of speaking) Some friends of mine are building their own house. They hope to finish it in next summer. 3. You can use the present continuous with today/this week/this year etc.(Periods around now). You’re working hard today. (not You work hard today) The company I work for isn’t doing well this year. 4. We use the present continuous when we talk about changes happening around now, especially with these verbs:get change become increase rise fall grow improve begin start Is your English getting better? (not Does your English get better) The population of the world is increasing very fast. (not increases) At first I didn’t like my job, but I’m beginning to enjoy it now. (not I begin) 总结 正在做某事 事情已经开始，还没有结束，但是此刻你可能没在做 和具体的时间连用 如：today, this week, this year 某些变化词, 如: getting、 becoming、 rise……..]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[recently, I want to use my pc’s git to manage two github account. so after search a lot, I find a way to accomplish it If you never use git, maybe you should just google how to use it. It’s a very powerful tool.Since I have used it, so my .ssh folder has id_rsa and id_rsa.pub file. That is the ssh key between my pc’s git and github.In order to manage two github account. The first thing I have to is create two different ssh keys. 123456789101112$ cd .ssh&amp;&amp;ls .sshid_rsa.pub id_rsa ssh_auth_sock$ mv id_rsa.pub id_rsa_A.pub //first ssh key $ mv id_rsa id_rsa_A$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your email" //you should specify ssh key name under the command's output information$ ls .ssh //the final resultid_rsa_A.pub id_rsa_A ssh_auth_sockid_rsa_B.pub id_rsa_B Then add ssh key to ssh agen12$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_A$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_B The next step is copy two ssh key(id_rsa_A and id_rsa_b content) to github account. Then edit config file(if non-exist, create it) under .ssh folder. add following content. The most important is Host and IdentityFile. 1234567891011121314151617181920# configuration 1 # Host github.com Host A.com # HostName 服务器ip地址或机器名 HostName github.com # User连接服务器的用户名 User A # IdentityFile 密匙文件的具体路径 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_A # configuration 2 # Host 服务器别名 Host B.com # HostName 服务器ip地址或机器名 HostName github.com # User连接服务器的用户名 User B # IdentityFile 密匙文件的具体路径 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_B Ok, test them!1234$ ssh -T git@A.comHi ***! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.$ ssh -T git@B.comHi ***! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access. No problem! NOTE! when you copy such as git@github.com:A/A.github.io.git. you should change it to git@A.com:A/A.github.io.git . then git remote add to you dictionary. Then push is ok.]]></content>
