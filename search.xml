    <content type="text"><![CDATA[recently, I want to use my pc’s git to manage two github account. so after search a lot, I find a way to accomplish it If you never use git, maybe you should just google how to use it. It’s a very powerful tool.Since I have used it, so my .ssh folder has id_rsa and id_rsa.pub file. That is the ssh key between my pc’s git and github.In order to manage two github account. The first thing I have to is create two different ssh keys. 123456789101112$ cd .ssh&amp;&amp;ls .sshid_rsa.pub id_rsa ssh_auth_sock$ mv id_rsa.pub id_rsa_A.pub //first ssh key $ mv id_rsa id_rsa_A$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your email" //you should specify ssh key name under the command's output information$ ls .ssh //the final resultid_rsa_A.pub id_rsa_A ssh_auth_sockid_rsa_B.pub id_rsa_B Then add ssh key to ssh agen12$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_A$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_B The next step is copy two ssh key(id_rsa_A and id_rsa_b content) to github account. Then edit config file(if non-exist, create it) under .ssh folder. add following content. The most important is Host and IdentityFile. 1234567891011121314151617181920# configuration 1 # Host github.com Host A.com # HostName 服务器ip地址或机器名 HostName github.com # User连接服务器的用户名 User A # IdentityFile 密匙文件的具体路径 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_A # configuration 2 # Host 服务器别名 Host B.com # HostName 服务器ip地址或机器名 HostName github.com # User连接服务器的用户名 User B # IdentityFile 密匙文件的具体路径 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_B Ok, test them!1234$ ssh -T git@A.comHi ***! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.$ ssh -T git@B.comHi ***! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access. No problem! NOTE! when you copy such as git@github.com:A/A.github.io.git. you should change it to git@A.com:A/A.github.io.git . then git remote add to you dictionary. Then push is ok.]]></content>
