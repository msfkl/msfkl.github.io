# Present continuous
---
Let's see an example:  

`She is driving to work`  

This means: She is driving now, at the time of speaking, The action is not finished  

 #### 1. `Am/is/are + ing` is the present continuous `I am doing something = I'm in the middle of doing it; I've started doing it and I haven't finished`


- Please don't make so much noise. I'm trying to work.(not I try)

- 'Where's Mark?' 'He's having a shower.' (not He has a shower)
	
- Let's go out now. It isn't raining any more. (not It doesn't rain)

- What's all that noise? What's going on? (=What's happening?)

#### 2. Sometimes the action is not happening at the time of speaking. For example: Steve is talking to a friend on the phone. He says:  

`I'm reading a really good book at the moment.It's about a man who...`  

Steve is no reading the book at the time of speaking. He means that he has
started it, but has not finished it yet. He is in the middle of reading it.  

More example as list:  

- Kate wants to work in Italy, so she's learning Italian. (but perhaps she isn't learning Italian at the time of speaking)  

- Some friends of mine are building their own house. They hope to finish it in next summer.  

#### 3. You can use the present continuous with today/this week/this year etc.(Periods around now).  

- You're working hard today. (not You work hard today)

- The company I work for isn't doing well this year.


#### 4. We use the present continuous when we talk about changes happening around now, especially with these verbs:  

`get change become increase rise fall grow improve begin start`  

- Is your English getting better? (not Does your English get better)  

- The population of the world is increasing very fast. (not increases)  

- At first I didn't like my job, but I'm beginning to enjoy it now. (not I begin)

# 总结
1. 正在做某事  

2. 事情已经开始，还没有结束，但是此刻你可能没在做  

3. 和具体的时间连用 如：today, this week, this year  

4. 某些变化词, 如: getting、 becoming、 rise........
