### difference between I always do and I'm always doing 
- I always do (something) = I do it every time:  

- I'm always Losing things = I lose things very often, perhaps too often, or more often than normal.  

### We use continuous forms for actions and happening that have started but not finished (they are eating/ it is raining etc.). Some verbs are not normally used in this way. Wed don't say `I am knowing` or `they are liking` ; We say `I know`, `they like`. 

*the following verbs are not normally used in the present continuous*

```
like want need prefer know realise suppose mean understand believe remember belong fit contain consist seem. 

```

*never use following verbs in present continuous*
```
think 
see hear small taste
```

*the simple or the continuous is ok*
```
look feel
You look well today or You are looking well today.
How do you fell now? or How are you feeling now?
I usually feel tired in the morning.(not I'm usually feeling).
```
*He is selfish and He is being selfish*
```
He's being = He's behaving/He's acting. 
such as:
		 I can't understand why he's bing so selfish. He isn't usualuly like that.(being selfish = behaving selfish at the moment)
		 He never thinks about other people. He is very selfish. (not He is being) (=He is selfish generally, not only at the moment.)


We use am/is/are/ being to say how somebody is behaving. It is not usually possiblie in other sentences.
		  It's hot today. (not it is being hot)
		  Sarah is very tired.(not being tired)
